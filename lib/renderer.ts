/**
 * This method should return a newly created node. For example, the DOM renderer would call `document.createElement(type)` here and then set the properties from `props`.
 *
 * You can use `rootContainer` to access the root container associated with that tree. For example, in the DOM renderer, this is useful to get the correct `document` reference that the root belongs to.
 *
 * The `hostContext` parameter lets you keep track of some information about your current place in the tree. To learn more about it, see `getChildHostContext` below.
 *
 * The `internalHandle` data structure is meant to be opaque. If you bend the rules and rely on its internal fields, be aware that it may change significantly between versions. You're taking on additional maintenance risk by reading from it, and giving up all guarantees if you write something to it.
 *
 * This method happens **in the render phase**. It can (and usually should) mutate the node it has just created before returning it, but it must not modify any other nodes. It must not register any event handlers on the parent tree. This is because an instance being created doesn't guarantee it would be placed in the tree â€” it could be left unused and later collected by GC. If you need to do something when an instance is definitely in the tree, look at `commitMount` instead.
